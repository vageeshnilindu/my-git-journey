# git add

## What is git add?

git add moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.

It prepares selected files to be included in the next commit.

## Why is it Important?

Git does not automatically include all changes in a commit.

This command helps me:
- Choose which files to commit
- Create clean and meaningful commits
- Avoid committing unwanted files

## Basic Syntax

Add a specific file:

```bash
git add filename
