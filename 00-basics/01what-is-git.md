# What is Git?

## What is it?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files over time.
It allows developers to save different versions of a project and work safely without losing progress.

## Why do we need it?
- To track code changes
- To go back to previous versions
- To collaborate with others
- To experiment without breaking the main project

## Key Idea
Git works locally on your computer and stores the full history of changes.

## Common Use Case
When you make changes to a project and want to save a checkpoint, Git helps you record it as a commit.

## Things to Remember
- Git is not GitHub
- Git works offline
- Every commit is a snapshot

## One-Line Summary
Git helps me track, manage, and control changes in my project safely.
